# Abstract {.unnumbered}

Interpreting limitations to plant growth requires understanding of the balance between carbon (C) source and sink activity in order to assess C allocation and biomass partitioning. This study used manipulations of soil volume to test how growth is coupled to physiology, allocation, and sink activity in *Eucalyptus tereticornis* seedlings. We grew seedlings in a large range of container sizes and planted containers flush to the soil alongside naturally sown seedlings (free). Reduced soil volume was expected to induce rapid negative effects on growth and physiology compared to free seedlings. It was hypothesized that soil volume effect would be largest in the smallest containers, resulting in physical constraints to growth independently of photosynthesis (A). Photosynthesis would then become sink-limited, resulting in the build-up of leaf nonstructural carbohydrates eventually leading to photosynthetic down regulation. We observed a negative container effect on aboveground growth soon after the experiment started. Although growth was consistently different across soil volumes mass, partitioning to leaves, stems, roots was conserved after 120 days. Photosynthetic capacity was also significantly reduced in containers, and was related to both leaf nitrogen content and starch accumulation. We developed a seedling growth model that utilized leaf A rates to allocate daily C uptake towards mass growth of stems, leaves and roots. We then asked whether the observed reductions in A explained the observed differences in seedling biomass. We found that although belowground sink limitation resulted in the down regulation of A, these reductions were not significant enough to explain observed growth responses. Thus, as photosynthesis and growth were not coordinated an excess pool of non-biomass C resulted in seedlings with soil volume restriction. This research highlights the need to further utilize mass balance approaches when evaluating plant C allocation and confirms that A and growth are not always directly related.

##Data analysis
Differences in experimental parameters with soil volume were analysed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) in R [@RDevelopment] with individual containers as random effects and soil volume as a categorical fixed effect. Tukeyâ€™s post-hoc tests were performed in conjunction with ANOVA to determine which specific paired comparisons among soil volume treatments were different. Mixed model ANOVAs of A~max~ and leaf chemistry were performed using the 'nlme' package [@nlme] in R and R^2^ values of mixed models were computed as in [@nakagawa2013general]. Tests of allometric relationships between biomass components were implemented using major axis regression in the 'smatr' package in R [@warton2012smatr]. Results were considered significant at P&leq;0.05..

**Table 1.** Responses of plant and leaf characterisitics of *Eucalyptus tereticornis* seedlings to soil volume treatments. Each value reflects the mean(standard error) for each treatment. Seedling mass, SRL, root nitrogen and leaf $\delta$^13C values are from final harvest. Values of leaf starch, sugars, nitrogen and SLA represent overall means across measurement campaigns (n=6). Different letters represent significant differences between treatments. The container effect P value represents the overall difference between seedlings with soil volume restriction and the control seedlings.
