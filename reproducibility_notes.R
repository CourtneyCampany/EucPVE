###reproducibility notes


###between thesis and pub

#1. I saved the figures and tables in a secondary RMD, maybe easier to convert back from thesis (which are inbedded)
#2. Figure #s in thesis inbedded have been re# with thesis chapter Figure #.#
#3. Likely will need to use pdf figures anyway, but then a list of figure tables is available.

#4. for RMD will use two dummy docx files for thesis and pub, thesis will need to reflect binding requirements.
